# 🎓 University Course Management System (Android)

## 📝 Project Overview

This is a fully-featured Android application designed to provide university lecturers with a powerful and intuitive tool for managing their courses and student enrolments. The app streamlines administrative tasks by allowing lecturers to dynamically create courses, manage student records, and view detailed information all from their mobile device.

Built with a focus on a clean user interface and robust data management, this project serves as a practical demonstration of modern Android development principles, including `Activity` lifecycle management, `RecyclerView` for efficient data display, and persistent local data storage.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Course Creation & Management:** Lecturers can dynamically create new courses by providing a course code, name, and their own name. All existing courses are displayed in a clean, scrollable list on the main screen.
* **Detailed Course View:** Tapping a course reveals a detailed view showing all enrolled students, allowing lecturers to see their roster at a glance.
* **Full Student CRUD Functionality:** The app supports complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for students within a course.
    * **Add Students:** Easily add new students to a course with validation to prevent duplicate enrolments based on matriculation number.
    * **Edit Student Details:** Update a student's name, email, or matriculation number through a simple dialogue-triggered edit screen.
    * **Remove Students:** Remove a student from a specific course without deleting their master record from the system.
* **Intuitive Navigation & UI:** The application uses `FloatingActionButton`s for primary actions (creating courses, adding students) and `RecyclerView`s for efficient, smooth scrolling of long lists. Actions like deleting a course are handled via an intuitive long-press gesture.
* **Data Persistence:** All course and student data is saved to a local database, ensuring that information is retained between app launches.
